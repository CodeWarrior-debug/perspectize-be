# Dependency Security & Vulnerability Scanning

How Perspectize scans dependencies for known vulnerabilities, how to remediate
findings, and the non-obvious gotchas that make a "security updates" PR take
longer than expected.

> Scope: dependency CVE scanning (Trivy + `pnpm audit` + `govulncheck`).
> For secret management, auth layers, and rotation, see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## The scanner setup

| Scanner | Scope | Where it runs |
|---------|-------|---------------|
| **Trivy** (`.github/workflows/trivy.yml`) | `backend/go.mod` + `frontend/pnpm-lock.yaml`, **production deps only** (dev deps suppressed) | CI gate on PRs touching lockfiles |
| **`pnpm audit --prod`** | Frontend production dependency tree | Local, before pushing lockfile changes |
| **`govulncheck`** | Go modules, **call-graph aware** (only reports vulns you actually reach) | Local, optional deeper check |
| **Dependabot** | Opens PRs for outdated/vulnerable deps (`gomod`, `npm`, `github-actions`, `gradle`, `docker`) | Automated |

The Trivy workflow is the **CI gate**. It triggers only when
`frontend/pnpm-lock.yaml`, `backend/go.sum`, or the workflow file itself
changes, and fails the build on `HIGH,CRITICAL` findings.

## Remediation workflow

When the security scan is red (or before opening a deps PR):

```bash
# 1. Frontend — see what Trivy will see (production tree, not just direct deps)
pnpm --dir frontend audit --prod

# 2. Backend — reproduce Trivy's Go findings locally with the real tool
#    (install once: see below). govulncheck is call-graph aware and may report
#    fewer; Trivy matches the dependency graph and is what CI uses.
curl -sfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aquasecurity/trivy/main/contrib/install.sh \
  | sh -s -- -b /tmp/trivy-bin v0.71.0
/tmp/trivy-bin/trivy fs . --severity HIGH,CRITICAL --exit-code 1 --format table

# 3. Bump the offending package to its patched version
#    Frontend: edit package.json, then:
pnpm install --dir frontend
#    Backend:
cd backend && go get <module>@<patched-version> && go mod tidy

# 4. Re-run the local scan until it reports 0 / 0, then verify nothing broke
cd backend && go build ./... && go test ./...
pnpm --dir frontend run test:run
```

Always run the local Trivy `--format table` scan before pushing — it's the
exact gate CI uses and prints a readable findings table.

## Gotchas (learned the hard way)

### 1. `trivy-action` + `format: sarif` ignores the severity filter for exit-code

The `aquasecurity/trivy-action` builds the SARIF report **"with all
severities"** regardless of the `severity:` input, and then evaluates
`exit-code` against that full set. Result: a leftover LOW/MEDIUM transitive
finding fails the build even when there are **zero** HIGH/CRITICAL.

**Fix:** gate on a `table`-format step (which *does* respect `severity:`), and
make the SARIF step upload-only:

```yaml
# Gating step — respects severity filter, prints findings to the log
- uses: aquasecurity/trivy-action@master
  with:
    scan-type: fs
    scan-ref: .
    severity: HIGH,CRITICAL
    exit-code: 1
    format: table

# Upload-only — never fails the build; feeds the GitHub Security tab
- uses: aquasecurity/trivy-action@master
  if: always()
  with:
    scan-type: fs
    scan-ref: .
    severity: HIGH,CRITICAL
    limit-severities-for-sarif: true   # keep the tab scoped too
    exit-code: 0
    format: sarif
    output: trivy-results.sarif
```

### 2. `format: sarif` hides findings from the GHA log

SARIF output goes to a file (uploaded to the Security tab), so a failing run
shows only `Process completed with exit code 1` with no detail. Always have the
**gating** step use `format: table` so findings are visible inline in the run
log. Don't debug Trivy failures from the log alone — reproduce locally.

### 3. `pnpm audit` ≠ what Trivy sees — use `--prod`

Trivy scans the **production** dependency tree, including transitive deps pulled
in through peer dependencies. Plain `pnpm audit` (all deps) can both over-report
(dev-only noise) and miss the framing CI cares about. Use `pnpm audit --prod`.

Real example: `svelte-clerk` peer-depends on `@sveltejs/kit`, which dragged in
vulnerable `vite`, `devalue`, and `cookie`. None were direct dependencies —
they only surfaced under `--prod`, the same view Trivy uses.

### 4. Different scanners use different databases

`pnpm audit` uses the npm advisory DB; Trivy uses its own (which includes Go
advisories npm never sees). A clean `pnpm audit` does **not** mean Trivy is
clean. Example: `go-jose/v3` CVE-2026-34986 (HIGH) was flagged by Trivy's Go DB
and invisible to npm tooling. Run the scanner that gates CI, not a proxy.

### 5. Prefer `^` over `>=` in pnpm `overrides`

`>=x` lets a transitive resolve to a future **major** version with breaking
changes. `^x` pins to the current major while still taking the security patch.

```jsonc
"pnpm": {
  "overrides": {
    "cookie": "^0.7.0",          // good: patched, but won't jump to 1.x
    "picomatch": "^4.0.4"
    // avoid: "cookie": ">=0.7.0"
  }
}
```

When overriding a package only on a specific path, scope it:
`"tinyglobby>picomatch": "^4.0.4"`. (Note: an override version must actually
exist — e.g. there is no `picomatch@2.3.2`; the v2 line tops out at `2.3.1`.)

**Exception — pin exact when a specific version must be excluded.** Caret only
bounds the *major* (or, below `1.0.0`, the *minor*) — it doesn't exclude a
single bad version within that range. If the override exists to keep a
*specific* published version out (blocked by `minimumReleaseAge`, see #7
below; or a known regression), use an exact pin instead:

```jsonc
"prosemirror-transform": "1.12.0"   // exact: 1.12.1 satisfies ^1.12.0 too,
                                     // so caret wouldn't exclude it
```

**Exception — compound OR ranges for a skipped vulnerable band.** `nanoid`'s
override (`>=3.3.18 <5 || >=5.1.6 <6`) intentionally spans two major versions
to support both v3 and v5 consumers while excluding an all-vulnerable v4 —
don't collapse this to a single caret (`^5.1.6` would drop the v3 band
entirely and could break dependents pinned to it; see `de712a4` for the CI
compat break from over-narrowing this once already).

### 6. A path-filtered workflow won't re-run on workflow-only edits

If a workflow has a `paths:` filter, editing **only** the workflow file does not
re-trigger it — and a path-skipped run leaves the PR showing the stale previous
status. Add the workflow file to its own `paths:` so config changes re-validate:

```yaml
on:
  pull_request:
    paths:
      - "frontend/pnpm-lock.yaml"
      - "backend/go.sum"
      - ".github/workflows/trivy.yml"   # re-run when the scan config changes
```

### 7. pnpm's `minimumReleaseAge` blocks freshly-published transitive deps

pnpm (10.16+) refuses to install a lockfile entry published within a rolling
age window (default 24h) as a supply-chain guard against just-published
(potentially compromised) packages. This isn't a CVE — it's a **timing**
check — and it fires on transitive deps you never touched directly:

```
✗ Lockfile failed supply-chain policy check
[ERR_PNPM_MINIMUM_RELEASE_AGE_VIOLATION] prosemirror-transform@1.12.1 was
published within the minimumReleaseAge cutoff
```

`prosemirror-transform@1.12.1` came in transitively via `@tiptap/*` (no
direct pin) and got resolved to the newest release, which happened to be
hours old. Same failure mode as `8939867` (`@sveltejs/kit` pinned to `~2.63.1`
for this exact reason).

**Fix:** add an exact-pin override (see the exception under #5) to the last
version that's already past the age window — check publish dates with
`npm view <pkg> time --json`. Don't disable or loosen the policy itself; it's
doing its job. The pin can usually be relaxed (or removed) once a newer,
now-aged release exists and there's a reason to move off the pinned version.

## Known unfixable findings

Some advisories have no patched release yet. Document them rather than
suppressing silently, and re-check when upstream ships a fix:

- **`lodash ≤4.17.23`** (code injection via `_.template`) reaches us only
  through `@vite-pwa/sveltekit > workbox-build`, a build-time dev dependency.
  There is no `lodash@4.18.0`; the fix must come from upstream `workbox-build`.
  Trivy suppresses dev deps, so this does not gate CI.

## Quick reference

```bash
# Frontend production audit (matches Trivy's view)
pnpm --dir frontend audit --prod

# Local Trivy gate (exactly what CI runs)
/tmp/trivy-bin/trivy fs . --severity HIGH,CRITICAL --exit-code 1 --format table

# Backend deep check (call-graph aware)
cd backend && go run golang.org/x/vuln/cmd/govulncheck@latest ./...

# Bump + tidy
cd backend && go get <module>@<version> && go mod tidy
pnpm install --dir frontend
```
