## Open Decisions

| Decision | Options | Status |
|----------|---------|--------|
| Frontend hosting | GitHub Pages, Vercel, Cloudflare Pages, Netlify | TBD in Phase 5 |
| Database provider | Sevalla (current) vs Neon (PostgreSQL 17, better analytics) | TBD — evaluate Neon for analytics drivers |

- **MOB-02**: Touch-optimized slider controls
- **MOB-03**: Mobile-first responsive refinements

### Advanced Perspective Features
- **PERSP-10**: Dynamic field types (data-type picker)
- **PERSP-11**: Multi-step wizard for detailed perspectives
- **PERSP-12**: CategorizedRatings support (custom categories)

### Content Types

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Mobile card layout | User explicitly excluded — desktop table only for v1 |
| Aggregate stats footer | User explicitly excluded — not wanted |
| Authentication/login | v1 uses user dropdown selector, no auth |
| Manual metadata entry | Backend auto-fetch should handle all cases |
| Infinite scroll | Against "calm browsing" goal — use pagination |
| Quick mode (agree/disagree) | All 4 ratings + Like + Review are the basic view |
| Real-time updates | Not needed for v1 |
