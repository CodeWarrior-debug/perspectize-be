### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 5 phases derived from 37 v1 requirements
- [Roadmap]: AG Grid validation in Phase 1 to derisk community wrapper early
- [Stack]: SvelteKit + TanStack Query + TanStack Form + AG Grid + shadcn-svelte + Tailwind CSS

- [01-01]: Upgraded Tailwind CSS from 4.0.0 to 4.1.18 to fix build errors
- [01-01]: Custom navy primary color: oklch(0.216 0.006 56.043) = #1a365d
- [01-01]: Type-based organization over feature-based for flat structure

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research]: AG Grid Svelte wrapper is community-maintained (v0.0.15) — validate in Phase 1 before committing
- [Research]: TanStack Query v6 requires thunk syntax for reactivity — enforce in code review
