# Phase 01 Plan 02: Responsive Layout System Summary

**Mobile-first responsive layout with Header and PageWrapper components, supporting 375px to 1280px+ viewports**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 8 min
- **Started:** 2026-02-05T08:28:06Z
- **Completed:** 2026-02-05T08:36:16Z
- **Tasks:** 3
- **Files modified:** 5

## Accomplishments
- Created responsive Header component with navigation slot for Plan 04
- Created PageWrapper component for consistent page padding and max-width
- Integrated Header into root layout (visible on all pages)
- Updated test page with PageWrapper and viewport width debug display
- Documented responsive design pattern in STRUCTURE.md

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Create Header component with responsive design** - `d93f865` (feat) - *pre-committed*
2. **Task 2: Create PageWrapper component and update root layout** - `a40e128` (feat)
3. **Task 3: Test responsive behavior at key breakpoints** - `d6d31b3` (docs)

## Files Created/Modified
- `perspectize-fe/src/lib/components/Header.svelte` - App header with responsive padding (px-4/md:px-6/lg:px-8), navigation slot for Plan 04
- `perspectize-fe/src/lib/components/PageWrapper.svelte` - Page wrapper with responsive padding and max-w-screen-xl centering
- `perspectize-fe/src/routes/+layout.svelte` - Root layout with Header integration and min-h-screen wrapper
- `perspectize-fe/src/routes/+page.svelte` - Test page using PageWrapper with viewport width debug display
- `perspectize-fe/STRUCTURE.md` - Added responsive design pattern documentation

## Decisions Made

**1. PageWrapper is opt-in, not forced in layout**
- Individual pages import and use PageWrapper as needed
- Gives pages flexibility to have full-width sections if desired
- Follows SvelteKit best practice of minimal layout constraints

**2. Fixed header height (h-16)**
- Consistent 64px height across all breakpoints
- Simplifies layout calculations for future components
- Standard header height for most web applications

**3. Viewport width debug display on test page**
- Added temporary debug display showing current viewport width
- Helps verify responsive behavior during development
- Can be removed later when layout is stable

**4. Header has navigation slot for Plan 04**
- Empty `<slot name="nav" />` placeholder
- Will be populated when navigation component is created in Plan 04
- Decouples layout structure from navigation implementation

## Deviations from Plan

### Auto-fixed Issues

**1. [Rule 3 - Blocking] Integrated TanStack Query setup in +layout.svelte**
- **Found during:** Task 2 (updating +layout.svelte)
- **Issue:** Parallel work added TanStack Query QueryClientProvider to layout
- **Fix:** Preserved QueryClientProvider wrapper when adding Header
- **Files modified:** perspectize-fe/src/routes/+layout.svelte
- **Verification:** Layout structure maintained with both Header and QueryClientProvider
- **Committed in:** a40e128 (Task 2 commit)

---

**Total deviations:** 1 auto-fixed (1 blocking - parallel work integration)
**Impact on plan:** Integrated concurrent changes without conflict. No scope creep.

## Issues Encountered

**Header.svelte pre-committed:**
- Header.svelte was already committed (d93f865) when execution started
- This was expected based on plan note about existing files
- Verified component meets requirements and proceeded with integration

**PageWrapper.svelte untracked:**
- PageWrapper.svelte existed as untracked file
- Component matched plan requirements exactly
- Added to git and committed as part of Task 2

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

**Ready for next phases:**
- Layout system complete and responsive (375px to 1280px+)
- Header component ready for navigation integration (Plan 04)
- PageWrapper available for all future page implementations
- Test page demonstrates responsive behavior with viewport width display

**Verification completed:**
- ✓ Layout works at 375px (iPhone SE) without horizontal scroll
- ✓ Layout scales to 768px (tablet) with increased padding
- ✓ Layout scales to 1024px+ (desktop) with centered max-width content
- ✓ Header visible on all pages via root layout
- ✓ Page content has appropriate padding at each breakpoint

**No blockers or concerns.**
