key-decisions:
  - "Used enabled: browser in QueryClient defaults to prevent server-side query execution after SSG"
  - "Configured svelte-sonner with top-right position and 2s auto-dismiss duration"
  - "Set up Vitest with jsdom environment and SvelteKit mocks"

patterns-established:
  - "GraphQL client pattern: centralized client in lib/queries/client.ts with environment-based URL"
  - "Query organization: feature-based query files in lib/queries/"
  - "Test organization: tests/ directory with setup.ts for shared mocks, tests/unit/ for unit tests, tests/fixtures/ for shared fixtures"

# Phase 01 Plan 03: TanStack Query & Testing Summary

**TanStack Query v6 with browser-only execution, GraphQL client for backend API, toast notifications (top-right, 2s), and Vitest testing with jsdom and coverage**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 17 min
- **Started:** 2026-02-05T08:28:38Z
- **Completed:** 2026-02-05T08:45:34Z
- **Tasks:** 3
- **Files modified:** 12

## Accomplishments
- TanStack Query configured with critical browser-only execution for SSG compatibility
- GraphQL client ready for backend API integration with environment-based URL
- Toast notification system with 2-second auto-dismiss and test buttons
- Vitest testing infrastructure with SvelteKit mocks and coverage reporting
- TanStack Form installed for Phase 3 perspective forms

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: TanStack Query, TanStack Form, GraphQL client** - `31c3b28` (feat)
2. **Task 2: svelte-sonner toast notifications** - `625f48c` (feat)
3. **Task 3: Vitest with coverage reporting** - `8dd7737` (feat)

## Files Created/Modified

**Created:**
- `perspectize-fe/src/lib/queries/client.ts` - GraphQL client with configurable backend URL
- `perspectize-fe/src/lib/queries/content.ts` - Example content queries (LIST_CONTENT, GET_CONTENT)
- `perspectize-fe/tests/setup.ts` - SvelteKit mocks for $app/environment and $app/navigation
- `perspectize-fe/tests/unit/example.test.ts` - Example test suite demonstrating Vitest setup
- `perspectize-fe/tests/fixtures/.gitkeep` - Placeholder for future test fixtures

**Modified:**
- `perspectize-fe/vite.config.ts` - Added Vitest configuration (jsdom, globals, coverage)
- `perspectize-fe/src/routes/+layout.svelte` - Added Toaster component (note: QueryClientProvider added by 01-02)
- `perspectize-fe/src/routes/+page.svelte` - Added toast test buttons (success, error, info)
- `perspectize-fe/package.json` - Added dependencies and test scripts

## Decisions Made

**1. Browser-only query execution**
- Set `enabled: browser` in QueryClient defaults
- Rationale: Prevents TanStack Query from executing queries on server after SSG HTML is sent, which wastes resources and causes errors
- Reference: 01-RESEARCH.md pitfall #2

**2. Toast configuration**
- Position: top-right (per REQUIREMENTS.md SETUP-07)
- Duration: 2000ms (2 seconds)
- richColors: true for better visual distinction
- Rationale: User feedback should be visible but not intrusive

**3. Test infrastructure**
- jsdom environment for DOM testing
- globals: true for describe/it/expect without imports
- SvelteKit mocks in setup.ts to prevent test failures
- Coverage with v8 provider (faster than istanbul)

## Deviations from Plan

**Coordination with parallel plan 01-02:**
- Plan noted that 01-02 would also modify +layout.svelte
- 01-02 already added QueryClientProvider before 01-03 executed
- 01-03 added Toaster component to the QueryClientProvider wrapper
- Result: No merge conflicts, both changes preserved

---

**Total deviations:** 0 auto-fixed (expected coordination with parallel plan)
**Impact on plan:** No deviations. Parallel execution coordinated successfully.

## Issues Encountered

None - all tasks executed as planned with successful coordination between parallel plans 01-02 and 01-03.

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

**Ready for next phases:**
- Phase 02: AG Grid validation can use TanStack Query for data fetching
- Phase 03: Perspective forms can use TanStack Form and toast notifications
- Phase 04: Browse videos can use GraphQL client and content queries
- All phases can write Vitest tests with existing infrastructure

**Testing pattern established:**
- Tests go in `tests/unit/` for unit tests
- Shared mocks go in `tests/setup.ts`
- Test fixtures go in `tests/fixtures/`
- Run with `pnpm test` (watch), `pnpm test:run`, or `pnpm test:coverage`

**Important notes:**
- Remember to use TanStack Query thunk syntax for reactivity (see 01-RESEARCH.md)
- GraphQL endpoint defaults to http://localhost:8080/graphql, override with VITE_GRAPHQL_URL
- Coverage reports generate in `coverage/` directory (gitignored)
