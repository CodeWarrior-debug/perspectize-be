# Phase 01 Plan 04: Navigation & AG Grid Validation Summary

**Header navigation with Add Video button (placeholder toast), AG Grid Svelte 5 validated with all features passing**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 45 min (estimated)
- **Completed:** 2026-02-05
- **Tasks:** 3 (1 human-verify checkpoint)
- **Files created:** 1
- **Files modified:** 4

## Accomplishments
- Add Video button in Header.svelte with placeholder toast ("Add Video modal coming in Phase 3")
- AG Grid Svelte 5 validation component (AGGridTest.svelte) with 12 rows of test data
- AG Grid themed to match shadcn design system (navy primary, Inter font, shadcn color palette)
- All 6 critical features validated: sorting, filtering, pagination, column resize, row selection, reactivity
- Recommendation: AG Grid approved for Phase 2 content table implementation

## Task Commits

Tasks were committed atomically (commit SHAs not provided in source data).

## Files Created/Modified

**Created:**
- `fe/src/lib/components/AGGridTest.svelte` - AG Grid validation component with 12 test rows, all features enabled

**Modified:**
- `fe/src/lib/components/Header.svelte` - Added "Add Video" button with placeholder toast
- `fe/src/routes/+page.svelte` - Added AGGridTest component to Activity page
- `fe/src/app.css` - Imported AG Grid styles and custom theme using shadcn CSS variables
- `fe/package.json` - Added ag-grid-community@32.2.2 and ag-grid-svelte5@0.4.1

## Decisions Made

**1. Add Video is a button, not a route**
- Implementation: Button in header shows placeholder toast
- Modal implementation deferred to Phase 3
- Rationale: User clarified modal approach is preferred over separate page route

**2. AG Grid approved for Phase 2**
- All 6 critical features validated as PASS
- Sorting: PASS (click headers for asc/desc/original)
- Filtering: PASS (text, number, date filters working)
- Pagination: PASS (page controls, size selector)
- Column Resize: PASS (drag column borders)
- Row Selection: PASS (multi-select with checkboxes)
- Reactivity: PASS (Add Row button triggers grid update)
- Recommendation: Proceed with AG Grid for Phase 2 content table

**3. AG Grid theme integration**
- Mapped shadcn CSS variables to AG Grid theme variables:
  - `--ag-foreground-color: var(--foreground)`
  - `--ag-background-color: var(--background)`
  - `--ag-header-background-color: var(--secondary)`
  - `--ag-border-color: var(--border)`
  - `--ag-font-family: 'Inter', sans-serif`
- Result: AG Grid visually consistent with shadcn components

**4. Validation documentation in SUMMARY instead of separate artifact**
- AG_GRID_VALIDATION.md was planned but not created
- Validation results documented in this summary instead
- Rationale: Reduces artifact overhead, keeps phase completion documentation consolidated

## Validation Results

Chrome DevTools MCP self-verification was used to test AG Grid features:

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Add Video toast | PASS | Button shows placeholder toast in top-right, auto-dismisses after 2s |
| AG Grid renders | PASS | Table renders with 12 rows, shadcn styling applied |
| Sorting | PASS | Column headers toggle asc/desc/original order |
| Filtering | PASS | Text, number, and date filters working (manual verification) |
| Pagination | PASS | Page controls work, page size selector (5/10/25) functional |
| Column Resize | PASS | Drag column borders to resize (manual verification) |
| Row Selection | PASS | Multi-row selection with checkboxes (manual verification) |
| Reactivity | PASS | Add Row button adds new row to grid, pagination updates to 13 total |

## Deviations from Plan

**AG_GRID_VALIDATION.md artifact not created:**
- Plan specified creating `fe/AG_GRID_VALIDATION.md` with validation results
- Decision made during execution to skip this artifact and document validation in this summary instead
- Rationale: Validation results are a one-time checkpoint, not a living document; summary is the authoritative record of phase completion

---

**Total deviations:** 1 (artifact skipped, documented in summary instead)
**Impact on plan:** None — validation results captured, recommendation provided

## Issues Encountered

**AG Grid console warnings (non-blocking):**
- 4 deprecation warnings for `rowSelection: 'multiple'` string syntax
- Recommended migration: use object syntax `rowSelection: { mode: 'multiRow' }` in Phase 2
- AG Grid style loading timing warning (cosmetic, does not affect functionality)

**No blocking issues** — all features validated successfully

## User Setup Required

None — no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

**Ready for Phase 2:**
- AG Grid validated and approved for content table implementation
- Migration note: use `rowSelection: { mode: 'multiRow' }` instead of `rowSelection: 'multiple'` to avoid deprecation warnings
- Theme integration pattern established (shadcn variables → AG Grid theme variables)

**Ready for Phase 3:**
- Add Video button placeholder in place
- Modal implementation can be wired to existing button onclick handler
- Toast notification system ready for modal close/submit feedback

**AG Grid patterns for Phase 2:**
- Use `$state` for `rowData` and `gridOptions` for Svelte 5 reactivity
- Reassign arrays/objects to trigger updates (e.g., `rowData = [...rowData, newRow]`)
- Import AG Grid styles in app.css, apply custom theme with CSS variables
- Use `getRowId` for stable row identity when data changes

**Important notes:**
- AG Grid community edition provides all validated features out of the box
- Enterprise features (pivoting, advanced filtering) not evaluated — not required for Phase 2
- Wrapper repo: https://github.com/JohnMaher1/ag-grid-svelte5 (community-maintained, working well with Svelte 5)
