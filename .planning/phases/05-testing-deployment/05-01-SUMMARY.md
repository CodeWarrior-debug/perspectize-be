# Phase 05 Plan 01: Test Coverage — SKIPPED

**Coverage already meets all thresholds. No work needed.**

## Rationale

Tests added during Phases 2–3 brought coverage above all enforced thresholds. The plan was written when coverage was at 36–40%, but by Phase 3 completion it had risen to:

| Metric | Threshold | Actual |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| Statements | 80% | 87.6% |
| Branches | 75% | 83.1% |
| Functions | 80% | 88.1% |
| Lines | 80% | 90.1% |

154 frontend tests passing. 78 backend tests passing. `pnpm run test:coverage` exits 0.

## Verification

```
cd perspectize-fe && pnpm run test:coverage  # exits 0, all thresholds pass
cd perspectize-go && make test               # 78 tests pass
```
