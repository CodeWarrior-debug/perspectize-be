# Dependency graph
requires:
  - phase: 07-02
    provides: Database pool configuration, CONFIG_PATH env var, DSN validation
provides:
  - chi router with request logging middleware
  - /health endpoint for liveness probes
  - /ready endpoint with DB ping for readiness probes
  - Graceful shutdown with SIGTERM/SIGINT handling
affects: [deployment, monitoring, operations]

  - "Separate liveness (/health) and readiness (/ready with DB ping) endpoints"
  - "30s graceful shutdown timeout on SIGTERM/SIGINT"

patterns-established:
  - "chi middleware stack pattern for HTTP request processing"

# Phase 07 Plan 03: Server Infrastructure Hardening Summary

**chi router with request logging, health/readiness endpoints, and graceful shutdown coordination**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 1 min
- **Started:** 2026-02-14T01:57:34Z
- **Completed:** 2026-02-14T01:59:09Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files modified:** 3

## Accomplishments
- chi router handling all HTTP routes with middleware stack (RequestID, RealIP, Logger, Recoverer)
- Request logging middleware logs method, path, status, and duration for every request
- /health endpoint (liveness probe) returns 200
- /ready endpoint (readiness probe) returns 200 when DB reachable, 503 when unreachable
- Graceful shutdown with SIGTERM/SIGINT handling and 30s timeout
- All 11 Phase 7 success criteria verified

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Install chi router, add middleware, /ready endpoint, and graceful shutdown** - `c02b0d5` (feat)

Task 2 produced no file changes (verification only).

## Files Created/Modified
- `backend/cmd/server/main.go` - chi router setup with middleware, health/ready endpoints
- `backend/go.mod` - chi v5 dependency added
- `backend/go.sum` - chi v5 checksums

## Decisions Made

- **chi router selected**: Lightweight, idiomatic Go HTTP router with composable middleware
- **Separate health vs ready endpoints**: /health for liveness (process alive), /ready for readiness (DB connectivity)
- **middleware.Logger**: Automatic request logging (addresses M-06)
- **middleware.Recoverer**: Panic recovery prevents crashes from taking down server
- **30s shutdown timeout**: Allows in-flight requests to complete before process exits

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None.

## Phase 7 Success Criteria Verification

All 11 success criteria verified:

✅ **SC1 (H-01, H-02)**: Zero youtube adapter imports in GraphQL layer
✅ **SC2 (H-02)**: Resolver uses portservices interfaces
✅ **SC3 (H-09)**: CONFIG_PATH env var used
✅ **SC4 (M-01)**: Zero lib/pq imports in perspective_repository
✅ **SC5 (M-02)**: PoolConfigFromEnv and DB_MAX_OPEN env vars present
✅ **SC6 (M-05)**: extractVideoID function removed
✅ **SC7 (M-06)**: middleware.Logger present
✅ **SC8 (M-09)**: SIGTERM and SIGINT handlers present
✅ **SC9 (M-10)**: /ready and /health endpoints present
✅ **SC10 (M-12)**: SanitizeDSN used in logs
✅ **SC11 (M-17)**: ValidateDatabaseURL present

All backend tests pass (7 test packages).

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

Phase 7 (Backend Architecture Hardening) complete:
- Service port interfaces established
- lib/pq removed, custom array types implemented
- Database pool configurable via env vars
- CONFIG_PATH, DATABASE_URL validation, DSN sanitization
- chi router with request logging
- Health and readiness endpoints operational
- Graceful shutdown handling

Ready for Phase 7.1 (ORM Migration: sqlx → GORM) or future operational deployments.
