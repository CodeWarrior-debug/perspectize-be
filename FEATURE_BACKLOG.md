## Discover Page (New Page)

The v1 home page is an **Activity** page — a data table of user activity on videos already in the system. This is the correct approach for v1.

A future **Discover** page would be a separate page for finding new content outside the system:
- **Browse** — Show topics/tags from YouTube API endpoint, letting users explore categories
- **Search** — Live YouTube API search to discover new videos directly from YouTube

This is distinct from the Activity page's local search/filter. Discover reaches out to YouTube; Activity shows what's already tracked.
