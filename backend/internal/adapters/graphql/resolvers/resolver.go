// This file serves as dependency injection for your app. It also holds the
// root resolver wiring (the Resolver struct, its constructor, and the
// generated.*Resolver getter methods) so that content.resolvers.go,
// perspective.resolvers.go, user.resolvers.go, and category.resolvers.go
// each contain only the field resolvers for their own domain.
//
// gqlgen recognizes existing implementations by receiver + method signature
// regardless of which file they live in, so this split survives
// `make graphql-gen`: newly added fields land as stubs in schema.resolvers.go
// (there is only one schema.graphql source file) and should be moved into
// the matching domain file above.
